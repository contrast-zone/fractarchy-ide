> 
> Fractarchy-IDE is a content management system that tries to amplify the simplicity of coding in a fun and exciting direction of composing visual contents. This project blends a brand new markup language with a brand new visual interface.
> 
> Coders combine the heart of a playful child with the wisdom of an experienced elderly. Sure, there is a certain value in all the WYSIWYG tools around, but the most of them miss that mystical aura of having a full control at our fingertips. Something magical happens at the moment when a code begins to exhibit intended behavior, and capturing that valuable moment is something I want to convey to users of this project.
> 
> Visual designers combine the chaotic art of creativity with the intentional art of applicability. Personal preferences may play an important role in this process, but it seems there may exist a kind of universal phenomenon worth of converging about: the symmetry. That is why visual interface of this project tries to resemble a coherent system of input/output duality, hoping to get closer to igniting designer inspiration.
> 
> Using Fractarchy-IDE, we uncommonly combine coding with visual designing. Keep your souls safe in the comfort zone, but keep your hearts open, and join me on a journey of coding visual contents using a creation inspired from another world. You may have already heard of that world. It is called imagination. And, as you may already know, that world may be pretty awesome.
