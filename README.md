> ## promotional material
> 
> *Let me introduce you to Fractabase, a blend of a database tool and text processor. As one might already guess, Fractabase does things a bit differently. Some users will love it, some users will hate it, while some of us may even form mixed opinions given a plethora of affinity states. Distinctive design choices that were made in creation of Fractabase are supposed to embark users on a brave adventure while discovering its carefully weighed virtues and flaws. Its coding fragment requires an open minded approach to be understood, while its graphical fragment requires a venturesome spirit to have fun with. The combination of these two fragments provides an unique balance between contents creation and contents navigation. Finally, a fair amount of user creativity will be the judge of Fractabase fitness for particular purposes.*

## 1. about fractabase

Fractabase is a hierarchical fractal-structure inspired, parent-children orbiting, and zooming-elements based text and graphics organizer. It can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. Such purposes include organizing personal or business data and documentation.

### 1.1. contents creation

Composing contents in Fractabase is consisted of coding main `sdt` file and importing graphical or other resources. Simple, yet powerful `sdt` markup, templating and coding capabilities serve as a Turing complete data definition platform. `sdt` file format is based on a minimalist s-expr based environment created specifically for purposes of Fractabase, and it should bring an exciting "expert under the hub" glance to the overall Fractabase user experience.

### 1.2. contents navigation

The final result created by Fractabase brings all the contents to be shown inside orbitable and zoomable ovals that form a seamless dynamic fractal user interface. We navigate the entire fractal structure using only four kinds of gestures: (1) dragging inside the central oval area to pan its contents, (2) dragging orbiting ovals around the central oval to rotate them, (3) dragging any orbiting oval towards center to zoom it in, or (4) dragging central oval towards orbit to zoom it out.

## 2. use cases

Fractabase **is suited** to be used as:

- static content pages creation platform
- mind map tool
- digital workbook
- hierarchical database
- presentation slide show
- advanced studying organizer
- personal knowledge base keeper
- multi-purpose documentation system
- ...

Fractabase **is not suited** to be used for:

- dynamic content pages creation
